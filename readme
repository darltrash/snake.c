snake.c: a "snake" clone written in 200~ sloc of ANSI C

Motivations:
    This started as just an in-joke between friends and
    a little challenge I decided to put on myself, and it
    was pretty horrid.

    X11 is horrible and I hope it slowly stops existing.

How to play:
    Use your arrow keys to move your "snake" to the red 
    blocks, which will also make your "snake" grow in size.

    If your snake hits the border or itself, game over.

How to build:
    - You'll need a functional Linux machine or similar
    - Get the X11 libraries
    - Get GCC (for output binaries) or change the 
        makefile as you please
    - Clone the repo
    - Run "make".
