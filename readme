snake.c: a "snake" clone written in 300~ lines of ANSI C

Motivations:
    This started as just an in-joke between friends and
    a little challenge I decided to put on myself, and it
    was pretty horrid.

    X11 is horrible and I hope it slowly stops existing.

How to build:
    - You'll need a functional Linux machine or similar
    - Get the X11 libraries
    - Get GCC (for output binaries) or change the 
        makefile as you please
    - Clone the repo
    - Run "make".
